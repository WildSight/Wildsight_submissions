WILDSIGHT
Wildlife exists around us all the time, but most of us fail to observe it. Birds are one form of wildlife that can be found in great diversity even in crowded cities.
The benefits that a person as an individual, and society at large can reap from a simple activity like birdwatching still remain largely untapped. For an individual, it is a relaxing hobby that can help you reconnect with nature. For society, it can help spread awareness about the environment and help in mobilising the masses towards the environment movement.
Moreover, the vast majority of scientific research in ornithology generally revolves around studying the behaviours of endangered species (largely due to funding constraints), and the valuable data that can be gleaned from more commonly found species remains untapped.


Having recognised the benefits of including the general public in birdwatching and data collection, we tried to explore what barriers exist that prevent people joining in. We came to realise that there is no simple platform which can help people to start this activity. The existing sources are cumbersome to use and directed towards experienced people.  


Therefore, we decided to create a mobile application that can help people enter into the world of birdwatching. The application helps you do the following:-
* Get a list of the most commonly sighted species in your locality with their photographs. This list is based on the sightings that other users have had in the same locality. (Initially, it will be based on some pre-existing datasets). This will help the user quickly start identifying the most common species around them and get them involved in the hobby.
* Allows the users to enter the sightings that they had along with location and time data. These sightings will be stored by the system and can be retrieved by the user. 
* The system first checks the sighting against a list of species that exist in the area to ensure a non-existent species is not entered. Then, it takes this sighting and sends it to different users on the platform to verify. After a certain fraction of users verify the sighting, the sighting is added to a final list of sightings. In extreme cases, verification would be done by an expert. Thus, accurate data is collected from the public and can be used for further research. 
* The data from this final sightings list can be viewed based on location and species with respect to time. So the migration patterns of particular species, or all species at a particular location can be retrieved. This again can be used to study changing migration and habitation patterns.
